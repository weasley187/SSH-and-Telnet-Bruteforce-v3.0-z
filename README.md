# SSH-and-Telnet-Bruteforce-v3.0-z
# TELNET AND SSH BRUTEFORCE v3.0 # Made by: weasley#7489  # Download python3 and run the file as showcased in the video. # Put a list with vulnerable IP's in the scripts directory. # UPDATE: New things added to the bruteforcing method now it separates telnet and SSH ports. # Also added a connection to a server so have fun with that, you can now transfer the CPU usage. # You can now change the combos and also uncap the timeout as you requested it, so here you go. # Keep in mind it can crash your VPS if it overheats, so don't mess around with it (for your good). # For educational purposes only! If you abuse it or use it inappropriate I don't take any responsibility.
